  # A skipped job is treated as success when used as a required status check.
  # The registered required status checks refer to the name of the job in the
  # called reusable workflow rather than the jobs in this file.  The following
  # jobs need to run unconditionally to allow GitHub required status checks to
  # pass even when there are changed files. The `! failure()` condition runs
  # when the parent jobs completed successfully or were skipped. We pass an
  # 'if' argument to the called workflow to allow running it conditionally.
