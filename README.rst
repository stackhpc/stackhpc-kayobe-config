StackHPC Kayobe Configuration
=============================

This repository provides a base Kayobe configuration for the Victoria release
of StackHPC OpenStack.

StackHPC release train
======================

StackHPC provides packages and container images for OpenStack via `Ark
<https://ark.stackhpc.com>`__. For the Victoria release, only packages are
currently provided.

Deployments should use a local `Pulp <https://pulpproject.org/>`__ repository
server to synchronise content from Ark and serve it locally. Access to the
repositories on Ark is controlled via X.509 certificates issued by StackHPC.

This configuration is a base, and should be merged with any existing Kayobe
configuration. It currently provides the following:

* Pulp repository definitions for CentOS Stream 8
* Playbooks to synchronise a local Pulp service with Ark
* Configuration to use the local Pulp repository mirrors on control plane hosts

This configuration defines two `Pulp distributions
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/workflows/promotion.html>`__ for
packages, ``development`` and ``production``. This allows packages to be
updated and tested before rolling out to production.

Configuration
=============

The URL and credentials of the local Pulp server should be configured in
``etc/kayobe/pulp.yml``, using Ansible Vault to encrypt the password:

.. code-block:: yaml

   pulp_url: <url>
   pulp_username: admin
   pulp_password: <password>

The client certificate and key issued by StackHPC should be stored in
``certs/ark.stackhpc.com/client-cert.pem`` and
``certs/ark.stackhpc.com/client-key.pem``, respectively, with the private key
encrypted via Ansible Vault.

The distribution name for the environment should be configured as either
``development`` or ``production`` via ``stackhpc_repo_distribution`` in
``etc/kayobe/stackhpc.yml``.

Usage
=====

The following custom playbooks are provided in ``etc/kayobe/ansible/``:

* ``pulp-repo-sync.yml``: Synchronise package repositories in local Pulp with
  Ark.
* ``pulp-repo-publish.yml``: Publish synced package repositories under the
  ``development`` distribution.
* ``pulp-repo-promote.yml``: Promote the ``development`` distribution content
  to the ``production`` distribution.

See the Kayobe `custom playbook documentation
<https://docs.openstack.org/kayobe/victoria/custom-ansible-playbooks.html>`__
for information on how to run them.
