StackHPC Release Train
======================

StackHPC provides packages, container images, and host images for OpenStack via
`Ark <https://ark.stackhpc.com>`__. These artifacts are built and released using
a process known as the `Release Train
<https://stackhpc.github.io/stackhpc-release-train/>`__.

Deployments should use a local `Pulp <https://pulpproject.org/>`__ repository
server to synchronise content from Ark and serve it locally. This reduces
Internet bandwidth requirements for package and container downloads. Content is
synced on demand from Ark to the local Pulp, meaning that the local Pulp acts
like a pull-through cache.

Access to the repositories on Ark is controlled via user accounts issued by
StackHPC.

All content on Ark is versioned, meaning that a deployment may continue to use
older package repository snapshots and container images when newer content is
released. This allows for improved reliability & repeatability of deployments.

This configuration defines two `Pulp distributions
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/workflows/promotion.html>`__ for
packages, ``development`` and ``production``. This allows packages to be
updated and tested in a development or staging environment before rolling them
out to production. Typically a given environment will always use the same
distribution, meaning that package repository configuration files do not need
to be updated on control plane hosts in order to consume a package update.

Configuration
=============

This configuration provides the following:

* Configuration to deploy a local Pulp service as a container on the seed
* Pulp repository definitions for CentOS Stream 8, Rocky Linux 8/9 and Ubuntu
  Focal/Jammy
* Playbooks to synchronise a local Pulp service with Ark
* Configuration to use the local Pulp repository mirrors on control plane hosts
* Configuration to use the local Pulp container registry on control plane hosts
* Configuration to deploy pre-built OS images to overcloud hosts using Bifrost

Local Pulp server
-----------------

The Pulp container is deployed on the seed by default, but may be disabled by
setting ``seed_pulp_container_enabled`` to ``false`` in
``etc/kayobe/seed.yml``.

The URL and credentials of the local Pulp server are configured in
``etc/kayobe/pulp.yml`` via ``pulp_url``, ``pulp_username`` and
``pulp_password``. In most cases, the default values should be sufficient.
An admin password must be generated and set as the value of a
``secrets_pulp_password`` variable, typically in an Ansible Vault encrypted
``etc/kayobe/secrets.yml`` file. This password will be automatically set on
Pulp startup.

If a proxy is required to access the Internet from the seed, ``pulp_proxy_url``
may be used.

Host images are not synchronised to the local Pulp server, since they should
only be pulled to the seed node once. More information on host images can be
found :ref:`here <host-images>`.

StackHPC Ark
------------

The Ark pulp credentials issued by StackHPC should be configured in
``etc/kayobe/pulp.yml``, using Ansible Vault to encrypt the password:

.. code-block:: yaml

   stackhpc_release_pulp_username: <username>
   stackhpc_release_pulp_password: <password>

Package repositories
--------------------

CentOS Stream 8, Rocky Linux 8/9 and Ubuntu Focal/Jammy package repositories are
synced based on the value of ``os_distribution`` and ``os_release`` . If you
need to sync multiple RHEL-like distributions or Ubuntu releases,
``stackhpc_pulp_sync_centos_stream8``, ``stackhpc_pulp_sync_rocky_8``
``stackhpc_pulp_sync_rocky_9``, ``stackhpc_pulp_sync_ubuntu_jammy`` and
``stackhpc_pulp_sync_ubuntu_focal`` in ``etc/kayobe/pulp.yml`` may be set to
``true``.

On Ark, each package repository provides versioned snapshots using a datetime
stamp (e.g. ``20220817T082321``). The current set of tested versions is defined
in ``etc/kayobe/pulp-repo-versions.yml``. This file is managed by the StackHPC
Release Train and should generally not be modified by consumers of this
repository.

Package managers
----------------

For Ubuntu Focal and Jammy systems, the package manager configuration is provided by
``stackhpc_apt_repositories`` in ``etc/kayobe/apt.yml``.

The configuration is applied by default to all Ubuntu Focal and Jammy hosts. The
configuration can be overridden by changing the repository definitions in
``apt_repositories`` or toggling ``apt_disable_sources_list`` to use the default
apt repositories. This can be done on a host-by host basis by defining the
variables as host or group vars under ``etc/kayobe/inventory/host_vars`` or
``etc/kayobe/inventory/group_vars``.

For CentOS and Rocky Linux based systems, package manager configuration is
provided by ``stackhpc_dnf_repos`` in ``etc/kayobe/dnf.yml``, which points to
package repositories on the local Pulp server. To use this configuration, the
``dnf_custom_repos`` variable must be set, and this is done for hosts in the
``overcloud`` group via the group_vars file
``etc/kayobe/inventory/group_vars/overcloud/stackhpc-dnf-repos``. Similar
configuration may be added for other groups, however there may be ordering
issues during initial deployment when Pulp has not yet been deployed.

In both instances, the configuration points to package repositories on the
local Pulp server.

The distribution name for the environment should be configured as either
``development`` or ``production`` via ``stackhpc_repo_distribution`` in
``etc/kayobe/stackhpc.yml``.

Ceph container images
---------------------

By default, Ceph images are not synced from quay.io to the local Pulp. To sync
these images, set ``stackhpc_sync_ceph_images`` to ``true``.

HashiCorp container images
--------------------------

By default, HashiCorp images (Consul and Vault) are not synced from Docker Hub
to the local Pulp. To sync these images, set ``stackhpc_sync_hashicorp_images``
to ``true``.

Usage
=====

The local Pulp service will be deployed as a :kayobe-doc:`Seed custom container
<configuration/reference/seed-custom-containers.html>`
on next ``kayobe seed service deploy`` or ``kayobe seed service upgrade``.

The following custom playbooks are provided in ``etc/kayobe/ansible/``:

See the Kayobe :kayobe-doc:`custom playbook documentation
<custom-ansible-playbooks.html>` for information on how to run them.

* ``pulp-repo-sync.yml``: Pull packages from Ark to the local Pulp. This will
  create a new repository version (snapshot) for each repository in the local
  Pulp server when new packages are available. The new packages will not be
  available to cloud nodes until they have been published.
* ``pulp-repo-publish.yml``: Publish synchronised packages to the
  ``development`` distribution in the local Pulp. This will make synchronised
  packages available to cloud nodes using the ``development`` distribution
  (typically a development or staging environment). The new packages will not
  be available to cloud nodes using the ``production`` distribution until they
  have been promoted.
* ``pulp-repo-promote-production.yml``: Promote packages in the ``development``
  distribution to the ``production`` distribution in the local Pulp. This will
  make all packages currently available to cloud nodes using the
  ``development`` distribution also available to cloud nodes using the
  ``production`` distribution. Typically this would be done only once the new
  packages have been validated in a development or staging environment.
* ``pulp-container-sync.yml``: Pull container images from Ark to the local
  Pulp. This will create a new repository version (snapshot) for each
  repository in the local Pulp server when new image tags are available. If
  these are new container image repositories, then the new image tags will not
  be available to cloud nodes until they have been published.
* ``pulp-container-publish.yml``: Publish synchronised container images in the
  local Pulp. This will make synchronised container images available to cloud
  nodes.

Syncing content
---------------

A typical workflow to sync all packages and containers is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-repo-sync.yml
   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-repo-publish.yml
   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-container-sync.yml
   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-container-publish.yml

Once the content has been tested in a test/staging environment, it may be
promoted to production:

.. code-block:: console

   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-repo-promote-production.yml

Initial seed deployment
-----------------------

During the initial seed deployment, there is an ordering issue where the
Bifrost container will not yet have been synced, but the local Pulp container
has not yet been deployed. This can be avoided with the following workflow:

.. code-block:: console

   kayobe seed service deploy --tags seed-deploy-containers --kolla-tags none
   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-container-sync.yml
   kayobe playbook run $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/pulp-container-publish.yml
   kayobe seed service deploy

Working with pulp
=================

The `pulp CLI
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_cli/>`__  tool can be used to administer your local
pulp installation. Please follow the upstream documentation for installation
instructions.

pulp CLI tricks
---------------

Saving credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is useful to avoid the need to always supply your credentials when running commands
from the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv-pulp) [stack@seed ~]$ pulp config create --username admin --base-url http://<pulp server>:8080 --password <password>


Troubleshooting
---------------

HTTP Error 400: Bad Request {"name":["This field must be unique."]}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have previously tried to push an image to pulp e.g for local testing, you may
see this message when you later try to run ``pulp-container-sync.yml``:

.. code-block:: console

    TASK [stackhpc.pulp.pulp_repository : Setup container repositories] *****************************
    failed: [localhost] (item=stackhpc/centos-source-prometheus-jiralert) => changed=false
    ansible_loop_var: item
    item:
      name: stackhpc/centos-source-prometheus-jiralert
      policy: on_demand
      remote_password: password
      remote_username: username
      state: present
      url: https://ark.stackhpc.com
    msg: 'HTTP Error 400: Bad Request b''{"name":["This field must be unique."]}'''

The issue is that pushing an image automatically creates a `container-push repository
<https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_container/restapi.html#tag/Repositories:-Container-Push>`__
which conflicts with the creation of a regular container repository of the same
name. You can resolve this conflict by deleting the distribution associated
with the push repository using the pulp CLI:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv-pulp) [stack@seed ~]$ pulp --base-url http://<pulp server>:8080--username admin --password <password> container distribution destroy --name stackhpc/centos-source-prometheus-jiralert
    Started background task /pulp/api/v3/tasks/1f0a474a-b7c0-44b4-9ef4-ed633077f4d8/
    .Done.

HTTP Error 404: Not Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your login credentials are incorrect, or lack the required permissions,
you will see a 404 error during ``pulp-repo-sync.yml``:

.. code-block:: console

    TASK [stackhpc.pulp.pulp_repository : Sync RPM remotes into repositories] ****************************************************************************************************************************************
    An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: Exception: Task failed to complete. (failed; 404, message='Not Found', url=URL('https://ark.stackhpc.com/pulp/content/centos/8-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/os/20211122T102435'))

      msg: Task failed to complete. (failed; 404, message='Not Found', url=URL('https://ark.stackhpc.com/pulp/content/centos/8-stream/BaseOS/x86_64/os/20211122T102435')) '''

The issue can be rectified by updating the ``stackhpc_release_pulp_username``
and ``stackhpc_release_pulp_password`` variables.
