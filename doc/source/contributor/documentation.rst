Documentation
=============

This documentation is provided in the ``doc`` directory. To build it, run:

.. code-block:: console

   tox -e docs

The HTML will be written to ``doc/build``, and may be viewed in a web browser.

Documentation is hosted on readthedocs.io. Multiple maintainers can be added
for the project. GitHub integration ensures that each version is built when the
corresponding branch is pushed to.

Each release is hosted as a separate version, and new versions will need to be
added manually.
