Overview
========

This documentation covers the StackHPC Kayobe configuration. It is intended to
complement, rather than replace, the upstream :kayobe-doc:`Kayobe </>`,
:kolla-doc:`Kolla </>` and :kolla-ansible-doc:`Kolla Ansible </>`
documentation.

The configuration includes various things, such as:

* Opinionated configuration
* Custom playbooks
* Continuous Integration (CI) workflows
