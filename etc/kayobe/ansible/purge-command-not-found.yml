# Currently the pulp_deb plugin in Pulp does not support certain types of
# content, including i18n files and command-not-found indices. This breaks APT
# when the command-not-found is installed. This playbook can be used to
# uninstall the package, prior to running any other APT commands. It may be
# installed as a hook to the 'host configure' commands.
# See https://github.com/pulp/pulp_deb/issues/419
# FIXME: If used as a hook, this playbook matches all hosts, so will run
# against the seed, even when running 'overcloud host configure'. Depending on
# the stage of deployment, some hosts may be unreachable. This could be fixed
# by implementing this playbook separately for each group.
