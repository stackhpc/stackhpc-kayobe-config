# Custom playbook to configure a swap device. This may be used as a
# post-overcloud host configure hook.
#
# Variables:
# * swap_group: Host pattern against which to target the playbook. Default is
#               'overcloud'.
# * swap_device: Name of the swap device to configure. Default is
#                '/dev/rootvg/lv_swap'. To use a different value, set an extra
#                var (e.g. in $KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/swap.yml) because play vars
#                take precedence over any inventory variable.
