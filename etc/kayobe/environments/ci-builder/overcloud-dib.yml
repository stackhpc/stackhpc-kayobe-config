# Overcloud host disk image configuration.

###############################################################################
# Diskimage-builder configuration for overcloud host disk images.

# Whether to build host disk images with DIB directly instead of through
# Bifrost. Setting it to true disables Bifrost image build and allows images to
# be built with the `kayobe overcloud host image build` command. Default value
# is False. This will change in a future release.
overcloud_dib_build_host_images: true

# List of overcloud host disk images to build. Each element is a dict defining
# an image in a format accepted by the stackhpc.os-images role. Default is to
# build an image named "deployment_image" configured with the overcloud_dib_*
# variables defined below: {"name": "deployment_image", "elements": "{{
# overcloud_dib_elements }}", "env": "{{ overcloud_dib_env_vars }}",
# "packages": "{{ overcloud_dib_packages }}"}.
