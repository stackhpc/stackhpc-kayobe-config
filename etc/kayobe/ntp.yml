# Kayobe NTP configuration.

# Timezone configuration has moved to time.yml.
#
# Support for running an NTP daemon on the host is no longer available.
# Instead the Kolla Ansible 'chrony' container is deployed by default. Set
# 'kolla_enable_chrony' to 'false' in kolla.yml to disable it.
#
# This file will be removed in the Victoria release.
