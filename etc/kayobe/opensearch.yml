# Log retention

# If no retention policy is configured, then we apply one during Kayobe
# overcloud post configure. This ensures that we do not have unbounded log
# storage.
#
# Once a retention policy has been applied, it should be administered from
# the OpenSearch Dashboards UI. Any changes made in this file will not
# be applied to an existing policy. This is to prevent overwriting changes
# which have been made in the UI.

# OpenSearch cluster to apply retention policy to. You must customise
# this according to your deployment.
# opensearch_internal_endpoint: "http://{{ kolla_internal_fqdn }}:9200"

# OpenSearch index pattern to apply retention policy to. You must
# customise this according to your deployment.
# opensearch_log_index_pattern: "flog-*"

# Duration after which an index is staged for deletion. This is implemented
# by closing the index. Whilst in this state the index contributes negligible
# load on the cluster and may be manually re-opened if required.

# Duration after which an index is permanently erased from the cluster.
