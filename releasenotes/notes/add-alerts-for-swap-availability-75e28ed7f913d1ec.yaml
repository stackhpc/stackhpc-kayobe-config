    Added two alerts (warning and critical) that are triggered when the ratio
    of (free_swap_space / total_swap_space) is below thresholds.
    Each threshold can be modified by altering value of
    ``alertmanager_node_free_swap_warning_threshold_ratio`` and
    ``alertmanager_node_free_swap_critical_threshold_ratio``.

    Currently this solution has limitation of having one-size fits all policy.
    This can cause unwanted alerts for the hosts which utilise swap heavily
    Therefore it is recommended to tune the thresholds or apply silence rules
    for the needs.
