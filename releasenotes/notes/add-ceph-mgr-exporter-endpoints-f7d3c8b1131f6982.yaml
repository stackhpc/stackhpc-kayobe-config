    Adds code to the globals.yml file to add endpoints for the
    ceph_mgr_exporter. If ceph is configured correctly, managers will be
    under the mgrs inventory group. If this group is empty, then the
    variable will just be empty (the KA default). This also requires
    setting ``kolla_enable_prometheus_ceph_mgr_exporter`` to ``true``.
