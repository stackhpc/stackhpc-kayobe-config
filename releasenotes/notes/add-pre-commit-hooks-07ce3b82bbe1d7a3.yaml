    Add playbook to install pre-commit hooks and register them with git.
    The hooks currently configured to be installed will check yaml syntax,
    fix new line at end of file and remove excess whitespace. This is
    currently opt-in which can be achieved by running `install-pre-commit-hooks`
    playbook.
