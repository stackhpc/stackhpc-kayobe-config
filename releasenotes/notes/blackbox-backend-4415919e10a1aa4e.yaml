    Added Blackbox monitoring for backend endpoints by default. Note that this
    configuration will only work if the Blackbox exporters have access to the
    backend endpoints.
issues:
  - |
    Backend Blackbox monitoring will not work if the exporter does not have
    access to the backend OpenStack endpoints. This ususally happens when
    separate monitoring nodes are deployed. In this case, move the Blackbox
    exporter to the Haproxy group, remove the endpoints from
    `etc/kayobe/kolla/inventory/group_vars/prometheus-Blackbox-exporter`, or
    silence the alerts permanently.
