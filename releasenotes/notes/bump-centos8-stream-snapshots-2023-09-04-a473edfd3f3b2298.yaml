    Bumps CentOS Stream 8 snapshots to include fixes for Zenbleed
    (CVE-2023-20593) and Downfall (CVE-2022-40982). It is recommended that you
    update your OS packages and reboot into the kernel as soon as possible.

    CentOS Stream 8 snapshots have been bumped and new container images are
    available.  Make sure to sync these into your local pulp. The yum repositories
    must be reconfigured to exclude a `buggy version of iptables
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2236501>`__. To do this use:
    ``kayobe overcloud service reconfigure -kt none -t dnf``.

    CentOS Extras has been replaced with CentOS Extras Common. You may need to
    use the ``--allowerasing`` option with DNF if you have packages installed
    from the old repo. This is a one time only thing and on the next package
    update you can drop this argument.
