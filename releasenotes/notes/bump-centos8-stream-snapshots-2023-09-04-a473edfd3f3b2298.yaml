    CentOS Stream 8 snapshots have been bumped and new container images are
    available.  Make sure to sync these into your local pulp. The yum repositories
    must be reconfigured to exclude a `buggy version of iptables
    <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2236501>`__. To do this use:
    ``kayobe overcloud service reconfigure -kt none -t dnf``.
