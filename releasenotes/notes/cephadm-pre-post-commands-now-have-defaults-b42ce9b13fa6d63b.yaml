    The Cephadm pre and post commands now support default commands with the
    variables ``cephadm_commands_pre_default`` and
    ``cephadm_commands_post_default``. As such, any extra commands should be
    added to the variables ``cephadm_commands_pre_extra`` and
    ``cephadm_commands_post_extra``.
