    IPV6 is no longer disabled by default in the Ubuntu CIS hardening.  If
    using the old behaviour you may hit `2071443
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2071443>`.

    To match the new CIS benchmark defaults on Ubuntu, you should remove
    the ``ipv6.disable=1`` kernel command line option. If you wish to carry
    on with the current settings, change ``ubtu22cis_ipv6_required`` to
    ``false``.
