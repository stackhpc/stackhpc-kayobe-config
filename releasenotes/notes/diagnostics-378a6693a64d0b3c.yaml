    Adds a new ``diagnostics.yml`` playbook that collects diagnostic
    information from hosts.  The diagnostics are aggregated to a directory
    (``$PWD/diagnostics/`` by default) on localhost. The diagnostics include:

    * Docker container logs
    * Kolla configuration files
    * Log files

    *The collected diagnostic information contains sensitive information such
    as passwords in configuration files.*
