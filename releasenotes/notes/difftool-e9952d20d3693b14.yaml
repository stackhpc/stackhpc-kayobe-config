    Added a python script that will collate release notes to compare
    configuration branches. For now, it will compare the currently checked out
    branch to the latest SKC branch by default. It can also compare between the
    currently checked out branch and itself 4 weeks ago. The tool can be
    invoked with ``python tools/skcdiff.py`` to compare against SKC or ``python
    tools/skcdiff.py --month`` to compare agains itself.
