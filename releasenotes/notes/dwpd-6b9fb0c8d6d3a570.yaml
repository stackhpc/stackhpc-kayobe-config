    Adds a panel in the Hardware Overview dashboard to show DWPD (Drive writes
    per day) for NVMEs. This is calculated by dividing the total bytes written
    in the past 24 hours by the drive capacity. This is currently only
    supported on NVMEs.

    Adds alerts that will fire after 1 DWPD is sustained for 7 days, and a
    critical alert if 1 DWPD is sustained for 30 days.
