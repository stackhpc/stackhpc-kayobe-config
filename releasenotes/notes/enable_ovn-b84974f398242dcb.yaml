    Enabled ML2/OVN by default. Checks preventing accidental migration
    from ML2/OVS were added in Kolla Ansible. If you are using a Neutron
    plugin other than ML2/OVN, set ``kolla_enable_ovn`` to ``false``.

    OVN distributed FIP is disabled, to enable it set
    ``neutron_ovn_distributed_fip`` to ``true`` in
    ``etc/kayobe/kolla/globals.yml``.
