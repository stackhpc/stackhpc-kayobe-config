    Enabled ML2/OVN by default as checks preventing accidental migration
    from ML2/OVS were added in kolla-ansible. If you are using a Neutron
    plugin other than ML2/OVN, set `kolla_enable_ovn` to `false`.
    OVN distributed FIP is also enabled, to disable it set
    `neutron_ovn_distributed_fip` to `false` in `etc/kayobe/kolla/globals.yml`.
