    Fixes `CVE-2024-44082
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-44082>`_ with updated
    container images for Ironic services. Note that Ironic Python Agent images
    also need to be updated to fully fix this vulnerability. If this is not
    possible, a new configuration option
    ``[conductor]conductor_always_validates_images`` is available. See the
    `OSSA-2024-003 description
    <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-003.html>`_ for more
    details.
