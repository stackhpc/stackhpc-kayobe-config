    Adds a custom ``fix-houston.yml`` playbook to address dmesg errors, specifically:
    "tc mirred to Houston: device bond0-ovs is down". This error typically appears
    when OVS HW offloading is enabled, often in conjunction with VF-LAG and ASAP^2.
    Detailed usage instructions are provided within the playbook's comments.
