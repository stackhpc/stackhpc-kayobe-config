    Fixes an issue where HashiCorp Vault standby nodes would trigger a
    Prometheus alert. To apply this fix to an existing system, the HAProxy
    configuration for Vault (``kolla/config/haproxy/services.d/vault.cfg``)
    must be manually updated following the `Vault documentation
    <https://stackhpc-kayobe-config.readthedocs.io/en/stackhpc-2023.1/configuration/vault.html>`__.
