    Bump snapshots for Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) to bring in the kernel
    (linux-image-5.15.0-86-generic) with the SRSO mitigation. Together with the
    microcode from previous snapshots, this should fully patch the Inception
    vulnerability (CVE-2023-20569). You will need to update packages and
    restart for this to take effect.
