    Adds a new Prometheus alert ``HostNetworkBondSingleLink`` which will be
    raised when a bond is configured with only one member. This can happen when
    NetworkManager detects that a bond member is down at boot time. This alert
    can be disabled by setting ``alertmanager_warn_network_bond_single_link``
    to ``false``.
