    This patch adds OpenStack Capacity metrics and exporters to
    StackHPC Kayobe Config. This includes a deployment playbook,
    Prometheus scrape jobs and HAProxy configurations to support
    this change.

    To deploy the OpenStack Capacity Grafana dashboard, you must
    define OpenStack application credential variables:
    ``secrets_os_capacity_credential_id`` and
    ``secrets_os_capacity_credential_secret`` as laid out in the
    'Monitoring' documentation.

    You must also enable the ``stackhpc_enable_os_capacity``
    flag for OpenStack Capacity HAProxy and Prometheus configuration
    to be templated.

    You may also change the default authentication URL from the
    kolla_internal_fqdn and change the default OpenStack region
    from RegionOne with the variables:
    ``stackhpc_os_capacity_auth_url`` and
    ``stackhpc_os_capacity_openstack_region_name``.

    To disable certificate verification for the OpenStack Capacity
    exporter, you can set ``stackhpc_os_capacity_openstack_verify``
    to false.
