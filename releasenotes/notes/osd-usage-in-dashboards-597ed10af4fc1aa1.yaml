    Per OSD usage metrics are now available in the OSDs dashboard. The
    dashboard now includes a new section that displays a histogram of of the
    utilization of each OSD in the cluster. This can be useful for identifying
    OSDs that are outliers in terms of utilization, and may need to be
    rebalanced. Additionally, there is a histogram displaying the usage of the
    bluestoreDB for each OSD.
