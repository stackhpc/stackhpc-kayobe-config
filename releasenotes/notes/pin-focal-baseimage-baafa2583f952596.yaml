    Pin the OCI image tag used for the Ubuntu Focal base-image
    of Kolla image builds. This prevents packages in the image
    with the latest tag getting in front of StackHPC release-train
    package repositories. Ubuntu tag should be bumped when new
    packages are available in StackHPC release-train.
