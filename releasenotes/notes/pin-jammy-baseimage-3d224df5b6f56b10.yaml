    Pin the OCI image tag used for the base-image of Ubuntu-based
    Kolla image builds. This prevents packages in the image with
    the latest tag getting in front of StackHPC release-train
    package repositories. This tag should be bumped when new
    packages are available in StackHPC release-train.
