    Add support of the operator supplying the rated DWPD value for NVMe drives.
    There is a playbook ``get-nvme-drives.yml`` that will populate a new
    section in the ``stackhpc-monitoring.yml`` file with drive model names for
    NVMes in the cloud. The operator can then fill in the rated DWPD values for
    each drive.
