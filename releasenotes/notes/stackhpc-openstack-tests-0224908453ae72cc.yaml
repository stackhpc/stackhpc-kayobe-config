    Adds a new ``stackhpc-openstack-tests.yml`` playbook that executes tests in
    the `StackHPC OpenStack Tests
    <https://github.com/stackhpc/stackhpc-openstack-tests>`__ repository. Both
    the playbook and tests are currently experimental, and are currently
    targeting only an all-in-one CI use case.
