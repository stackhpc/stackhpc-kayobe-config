features:
  - |
    Upgrades kayobe-automation submodule to ``7676aa8``.
    
    Upgrades kayobe-workflows collection to ``v1.1.0``.

    Kayobe-automation config-diff now runs in parallel and generates both
    the old and new configuration at the same time. This should improve
    config-diff wait times.

    Add support for the `pulp-sync-content` run book.
deprecations:
  - |
    Kayobe-automation will now automatically detect vaulted files for the
    purpose of config-diff therefore, ``KAYOBE_CONFIG_SECRET_PATHS_EXTRA`` and
    ``KAYOBE_CONFIG_VAULTED_FILES_PATHS_EXTRA`` are no longer used
security:
  - |
    The upgraded kayobe-workflows collection increases the version of various
    Actions and containers used within GitHub based workflows, including increasing
    Docker in Docker to version ``27.3.1`` thus removing the vunerabilities present
    in ``24.0-git``.
