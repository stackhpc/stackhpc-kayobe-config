    The overcloud HashiCorp Vault playbooks have been modified to use the
    local Vault service rather than via HAProxy. This makes it possible to
    deploy and use Vault without HAProxy. This eliminates the previous
    bootstrapping issue where HAProxy needed to be deployed without TLS
    enabled while generating initial certificates.
