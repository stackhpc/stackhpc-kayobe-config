    Adds support for deploying GitHub runners and creating GitHub workflows
    for use within Kayobe Automation. Two playbooks and their requirements
    have been added to `ansible/` in addition to the relevant groups defined
    with some useful default variables where appropriate. Finally,
    documentation has been added to cover how to deploy these runners and
    workflows.
