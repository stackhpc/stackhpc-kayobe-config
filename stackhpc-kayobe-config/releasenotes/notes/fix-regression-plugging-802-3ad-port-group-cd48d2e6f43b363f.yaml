    Fixes issue where Netmiko devices were sending no commands to the switch
    since plug_bond_to_network is overridden in
    networking_generic_switch/devices/netmiko_devices/init.py and
    PLUG_BOND_TO_NETWORK to set to None.
    See `NGS bug report
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/networking-generic-switch/+bug/2041516>`__.
