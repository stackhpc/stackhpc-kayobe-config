    Fixes the smartmon script to be case insensitive when checking for
    the inital SMART info. This is to ensure that the script works
    correctly on systems where the output of `smartctl -i` is not
    capitalised as previously expected by the script. This leads to
    badly formatted .prom files which lead to node_exporter failing to
    scrape the file.
