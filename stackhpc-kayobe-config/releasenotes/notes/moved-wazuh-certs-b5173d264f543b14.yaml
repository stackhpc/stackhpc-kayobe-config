upgrade:
  - |
    The path used to store Wazuh certificates has changed. ``local_certs_path`` is
    now set to the environment directory e.g
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/environments/<environment>/wazuh`` or
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/wazuh/`` if not using environments. The contents of
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/wazuh/certificates`` should be moved to the
    new location and the empty directory should be removed.
  - |
    The ``local_custom_certs_path`` variable has been removed. Custom wazuh
    certificates should be moved to
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/environments/<environment>/wazuh/wazuh-certificates/``
    if using environments, or
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/wazuh/wazuh-certificates`` if not.
