    Neutron ovn db sync operation will no longer removes OVN metadata ports in
    networks with Octavia OVN Load balancers health monitors.
    A maintenance task process has been added to update the existing OVN LB HM
    ports to the new behaviour defined. Specifically, the "device_owner" field
    will be updated from network:distributed to ovn-lb-hm:distributed.
    Additionally, the "device_id" will be populated during update action.
